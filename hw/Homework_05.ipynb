Written work should be completed on paper, and coding questions should be done in the notebook. Start the work for the written portions of each section on a new page. You are welcome to $\\LaTeX$ your answers to the written portions, but staff will not be able to assist you with $\\LaTeX$ related issues. \n",

    "Every answer should contain a calculation or reasoning. For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ or `sum([(1/3)*0.8, (2/3)*0.7])`is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\""

    "## 2. Switching Chain ##\n",

    "\n",
    "**b)** For $n \\ge 1$, let $C_n$ be the number of *switches* up to time $n$. That is, $C_n$ is the number of times the chain changes state up to and including time $n$. For example, if the path is $0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1$, then $C_8 = 3$ (remember that the path starts at $X_0$). What is the distribution of $C_n$, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** In the path $010100$, $X_0 = 0$ and $X_5 = 0$, so there is a $0 \\to 0$ transition in 5 steps. Find the value of $C_5$ for this path; you don't have to turn it in. For your own understanding, create several more examples of $0 \\to 0$ transitions for different values of $n$, and find the value of $C_n$ in each of your examples. There are already some more examples in the given path $010100$. For example the initial segment $010$ is a $0 \\to 0$ transition in 2 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what is common to the values of $C_n$ that you found in your examples. Now fill in the blank with a word, and **justify your answer**. \n",

    "**d)** Now find $P_n(0, 0)$ using Part **b**. [Hint: Compare the expansions of $(p+q)^n$ and $(p-q)^n$. How can you use both of them to get just the terms that you need?] \n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Use Part **d** (not the balance equations) to find the stationary distribution of the chain. This will give you a complete proof of the stationary distribution in this case, whereas our general discussion of the balance equations relies on your acceptance of the main [convergence theorem](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_10/03_Long_Run_Behavior.html#convergence-to-stationarity) without proof."
