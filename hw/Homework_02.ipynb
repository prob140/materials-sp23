    "Your homeworks will generally have two components: a written portion and a portion that also involves code.  Written work should be completed on paper, and coding questions should be done in the notebook. Start the work for the written portions of each section on a new page. You are welcome to $\\LaTeX$ your answers to the written portions, but staff will not be able to assist you with $\\LaTeX$ related issues. \n",

For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ or `sum([(1/3)*0.8, (2/3)*0.7])`is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\""

The setting is simple but powerful: it demonstrates some fundamental ideas of Bayesian prediction. We will use the same ideas in more complex settings later in the course.\n",

So for example the chance of two heads in two tosses is $p \\cdot p$.\n",
