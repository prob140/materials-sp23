    "Cryptography is the study of algorithms used to encode and decode messages. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been successfully used to decode messages encrypted using substitution codes and also [more complex](http://probability.ca/jeff/ftpdir/decipherart.pdf) encryption methods. In this lab you will apply MCMC and the Metropolis algorithm to decode English text that has been encrypted with a substitution code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab is based on the paper [The Markov Chain Monte Carlo Revolution](https://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Network-course-readings/MCMCRev.pdf) by [Persi Diaconis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persi_Diaconis). It was presented at the 25th anniversary celebrations of MSRI up the hill, and appeared in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in November 2008. The code is based on [Simulation and Solving Substitution Codes](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~sbc502/decode.pdf) written by [Stephen Connor](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/stephen-connor/) in 2003.\n",

We used a Markov chain model and a scoring system to choose the decoder that had the highest score. That is, we chose the decoder that had the highest likelihood given the message. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the alphabet was small, we were able to list all the decoders and their corresponding scores. When the alphabet is large, making an exhaustive list of all possible decoders and scores is not feasible. That's where the Monte Carlo part of the algorithm comes in. The idea is to choose decoders at random using an algorithm that favors good decoders over bad ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will work with an alphabet consisting of all 26 English letters as well as a space character that will have a special status. **Before you begin, please review Sections [11.2](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_11/02_Code_Breaking.html) (Code Breaking) and [11.3](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_11/03_Metropolis_Algorithm.html) (Metropolis Algorithm) of the textbook.** The lab follows those sections closely.\n",

    "- Implement the Metropolis algorithm \n",
    "- Decode a message encrypted by a substitution code\n",

    "\n",
    "### Written Portion ###\n",
    "*  Scan all the pages into a PDF. You can use any scanner or a phone using applications such as CamScanner. Please **DO NOT** simply take pictures using your phone. \n",
    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image in CamScanner or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",
    "* It is your responsibility to check that all the work on all the scanned pages is legible.\n",
    "* If you used $\\LaTeX$ to do the written portions, you do not need to do any scanning; you can just download the whole notebook as a PDF via LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Portion ###\n",
    "* Save your notebook using `File > Save and Checkpoint`.\n",
    "* Generate a PDF file using `File > Download As > PDF via LaTeX`. This might take a few seconds and will automatically download a PDF version of this notebook.\n",
    "    * If you have issues, please post a follow-up on the general Lab 4 Ed thread.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting ###\n",
    "* Combine the PDFs from the written and code portions into one PDF. [Here](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) is a useful tool for doing so. \n",
    "* Submit the assignment to Lab 4 on Gradescope. \n",
    "* **Make sure to assign each page of your pdf to the correct question.**\n",
    "* **It is your responsibility to verify that all of your work shows up in your final PDF submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having difficulties scanning, uploading, or submitting your work, please read the [Ed Thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/35049/discussion/2398718) on this topic and post a follow-up on the general Lab 4 Ed thread."
