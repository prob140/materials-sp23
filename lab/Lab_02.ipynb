    "- Let $X$ be a discrete random variable. If you use an approximation to the distribution of $X$, then the total variation distance between the exact and approximate distributions measures the worst error you can make in approximating probabilities of events determined by $X$. \n",
    "- Many random variables in this lab have a large number of possible values, and the approximating Poisson distribution has infinitely many possible values. But no matter how large $n$ is, the *probable* values of all the variables are in a very small range — 0 through about 8 or 10 — because all of the distributions are roughly Poisson $(1)$.\n",
    "- The total variation distance between the distribution of the number of matches in a random permutation of $n$ elements and its Poisson $(1)$ approximation falls very sharply. By about 10 elements or so, you might as well use the Poisson distribution for the number of matches.\n",
    "- The total variation distance between the binomial $(n, 1/n)$ and Poisson $(1)$ distributions falls sharply as a function of $n$ and is below 1% even for moderate values of $n$.\n",
