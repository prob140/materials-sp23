    "Hash functions play a major role in cryptography and computer security. For example, servers verify passwords by comparing the hash value of an entered string with the hash value stored in a database. *Birthday attacks* take advantage of the birthday paradox to generate hash collisions and trick computers into accepting a malicious file in place of a previously-encountered safe file. \n",
