By contrast, the *Chinese Restaurant Process* is a discrete time stochastic process (that is, a random sequence observed at times 0, 1, 2, etc) that can be used as a model for clustering and does not assume a fixed number of clusters. Instead, the clusters evolve randomly as individuals enter the system, according to a specified probabilistic structure. The data could be categorical or numerical.\n",

Since then, the development of the theory of the stochastic process and its use in machine learning has been very much a Berkeley enterprise: Jim Pitman, David Aldous, and Mike Jordan are among the people involved. The restaurant analogy is due to Jim Pitman and our late colleague Lester Dubins, during one of their regular cafe meetings decades ago. Though there is a popular story that they came up with it while eating at a Chinese restaurant, in fact they were at the Strada on Bancroft and College, known at the time as the Roma. "

That's the number of different clusters observed.\n",

You can imagine infinitely many such tables at the start, or imagine new tables appearing magically each time a person's random choice is to start a new table. We prefer the second image because it consists only of the occupied tables.\n",

Table 2 is the next new table to be formed. We can't say exactly who will start it, because that's random. Table 3 is the third new table to be formed. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on the name:** In Prof. A's experience, nobody chooses tables at a restaurant, Chinese or otherwise, in the way described above. A former 140 student once proposed a better analogy of new freshmen choosing tables in a dining hall. But a large restaurant with large round tables was an image that caught on quickly. The CR process now has variations such as the [Indian Buffet Process](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/indianbuffet.pdf).\n",

    "### Written Portion ###\n",
    "*  Scan all the pages into a PDF. You can use any scanner or a phone using applications such as CamScanner. Please **DO NOT** simply take pictures using your phone. \n",
    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image in CamScanner or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",
    "* It is your responsibility to check that all the work on all the scanned pages is legible.\n",
    "* If you used $\\LaTeX$ to do the written portions, you do not need to do any scanning; you can just download the whole notebook as a PDF via LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Portion ###\n",
    "* Save your notebook using `File > Save and Checkpoint`.\n",
    "* Generate a PDF file using `File > Download As > PDF via LaTeX`. This might take a few seconds and will automatically download a PDF version of this notebook.\n",
    "    * If you have issues, please post a follow-up on the general Lab 3B Ed thread.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting ###\n",
    "* Combine the PDFs from the written and code portions into one PDF. [Here](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) is a useful tool for doing so. \n",
    "* Submit the assignment to Lab 3B on Gradescope. \n",
    "* **Make sure to assign each page of your pdf to the correct question.**\n",
    "* **It is your responsibility to verify that all of your work shows up in your final PDF submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having difficulties scanning, uploading, or submitting your work, please read the [Ed Thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/35049/discussion/2398718) on this topic and post a follow-up on the general Lab 3B Ed thread."
